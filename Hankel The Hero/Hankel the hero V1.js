The dull grey-ish creature, with its thick set frame and unfortunate face sneers at me. No troll is afraid of a 13 year old boy. A shiver runs down my spine as the creature looks at me, and whatever bravery I have left, fails. This creature, as ugly as it is, scares me. I look down, clenching my fists, hearing a low grow of laughter. My arms tremble, my hands clench into fists. I barely notice how numb my fingers are, compared to the twisting mass of knots in my stomach.","\n","^Behind me, I hear one of the women in the caravan let out a shout, and a young child begins to cry and scream. “Please, please don’t take the children!” The woman begs in desperation. And I turn my head to see another of the large grey trolls wrenching the child from the woman’s grip. The woman falls silent as the brute takes her child away. She hangs her head, clutching at herself.","\n","^The twisting mass in my stomach begins to writhe. This is wrong. Why is nobody doing anything? I bite my lip in frustration, forcing myself to remain still. There is nothing I can do.","\n","^The creature walks up to me, holding the struggling child by the arm. “What about this one?” it asks, grinning horribly as I tremble.","\n","^“Nah” Said the other. “He’s a tall one, but weak, look at his scrawny arms! No one would want to buy him.”","\n","^Relief washes through me, at least they’re not taking me.","\n","^“Please, please let me go.” The child’s voice faded to a whimper as they drag him away.","\n","^I’m hit with a sudden painful stab of shame. Nobody says anything, nobody moves. The troll cuffs the child around the head with one massive hand and he falls silent. Clenching my fists so hard my arms begin to tremble, I step forward.","\n","^“Wait.” To my surprise the pair of trolls actually stop, amusement on their twisted, brutish faces.","\n","^“Do you want to come with us?” One of them asks, laughing. “I’m sure we can find someone to buy you if you’re volunteering.”","\n","^“Or we could just turn him into soup.” The other offers with a shrug and a malicious grin.","\n","^A shiver runs down my spine, but I take another step forward. My legs unsteady, my head down, I walk up to the brute holding the child by the arm, and stomp heavily on his toes. The troll howls in pain and lets go, the boy, quickly scrambles back to his mother. Spluttering angry curses, the troll swings one massive arm, striking the side of my head with his and I fall into the mud. All I feel is pain, and I can hardly see, my vision swimming before my eyes.  I barely make out the shouts and urgent yelling over the ringing in my ears. I hear the sound of hurried footsteps as the rest of the group flee into the forest, leaving me behind.","\n","^“You little rat.” Mutters the troll again, kicking me in the ribs with one of his massive feet. I let out a scream, as several of my ribs break from the impact.","\n","^“You make a very poor hero kid.” The other says, looming above me as I gasp in pain. “And even if manage it, no one thanks you anyway.” Dazed and delirious from pain, I feel one massive hand grip my ankle, and drag me down the muddy road as I moan and gasp from pain.","\n","ev","str","^Next","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"prelude_unconscious"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"prelude_unconscious":[["^I slip in and out of consciousness, the rain stops some while later and the sky turns dark, the air frigid, as night sets in. At some point, I can feel that I’ve stopped moving, and I can hear vague noises of someone fighting and low angry shouts. Some bright flashes of light like lightening illuminate the clouds in the darkened sky, then silence falls. A hooded figure looms above me, long pointed ears and silver grey skin, long white hair surrounding a sharp angled face. A moon elf. I try to muster the strength to speak, but he lays a hand on my forehead, and I fade back into fitful sleep.","\n","ev","str","^Next","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Prelude_meeting"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Prelude_meeting":[["^I open my eyes and stare up at a ceiling. I’m in a bed, around me are shelves full of books and strange things. There are drawings pinned to the wall that I do not understand, diagrams of bodies marked with words and symbols. Curiosity battles with confusion in my mind. Where am I? Some wizards house?","\n","^I sit up, no spasm of pain shoots through me and to my surprise I feel fine. Through the small window I look out at the city street below. I was finally here! But, when had I arrived? I wince, remembering the trolls ambush, though nothing hurts, my limbs tremble and I bite my lip to keep myself from shaking. Some hero I’d turned out to be.","\n","^I turn at the sound of an opening door, and see the tall grey-skinned elf stride into the room.","\n","^“It’s you.” I say, not bothering to hide the suspicion in my voice.","\n","^The look the elf gives me is not quite hostile. “You know,” He says, looking down his nose at me. “most children would be grateful that I stopped them from being eaten by a troll.” He sounded tired and was clearly annoyed. “Here. Drink.” Abruptly he thrust a bowl of thick green-ish liquid into my unprotesting hands. I glance at it dubiously, but it smells like herbs, even if it looks like something you’d find coming out of an ogre’s nose. Shuddering at that thought, I lower the bowl, not drinking, though my stomach protests loudly. The elf man seems amused by this, and a smirk slides across his face. “Odd child.” He mutters, bending over and placing a long fingered hand on my forehead. “How are you feeling?” His voice is not quite what I would have imagined from an elf, it is low pitched and has painful sounding growl to it, like someone had once tried to crush his throat.","\n","^“Fine.” I respond automatically. “And thank you.” I add. Not wanting to be rude. Curious I peer at him as he leans closer, examining me. His hands, arms, face and even throat, are littered with scars and burn marks. “You’re not a wizard are you.” I say, my tone making it more of a statement than a question. For the first time he laughs. “And you are not an idiot.” He says smiling more broadly. “Which I find unexpected considering your performance with the trolls.” A flush of embarrassment colours my cheeks but I glare at the man.","\n","^“You were watching?”","\n","^“I was nearby.”","\n","^“If you were nearby you should have helped! Why didn’t you do anything to stop them before they tried to drag that poor boy away?”","\n","^The man didn’t answer straight away, but continued on with his examination, pulling back my eyelids to see the whites of my eyes. I didn’t ask what he was doing, I wouldn’t have understood it anyway.","\n","^“I am not a wizard.” The elf said standing back from the bed, apparently satisfied with the examination. “But magic is one of the many things that I know. And in response to your second question, clearly I did help because you have not been eaten. As for why I didn’t act sooner, curiosity mainly I suppose.”","\n","^I narrow my eyes, glaring at the man. Distaste clear on my face. Was he toying with me?","\n","^The elf man sighs. “What is your goal here young man?” He asks businesslike. “You were travelling to the city I take it, clearly from some small backwater hamlet that nobody’s ever heard of. Well, now you’re here! Why?”","\n","^I sighed, he was going to laugh at me, or make fun of me some more. But I had to say it. “I wanted to be hero, I came to find someone to train me.” I screw my eyes shut, waiting for the laugh.","\n","^“Good.”","\n","^“What?”","\n","^“Good. I would have been annoyed if I was wrong about you.”","\n","^The confusion must be showing my face, for he continues. “I was watching as you. I waited to see what you would do because I was curious about you. And I was not disappointed.” a grin stretches across his face. “Despite the fact that you knew it could get you killed, you fought back anyway. You didn’t accept the fact that there was nothing you could do. It was well done.”","\n","^I gape at him, mouth hanging open, incredulous. “But it didn’t do any good, I couldn’t stop them.”","\n","^The elf shrugs. “The boy didn’t get eaten, that’s good isn’t it?”","\n","^I shut my mouth, unable to protest, but frowning. “I was afraid. I knew there was nothing I could do and it terrified me.”","\n","^The elf smiles warmly at me. “But you fought back anyway. You have the makings of a true hero, there aren’t many of us like that any more.”","\n","^I lower my head, frowning at my knees. Then a word catches my attention. “Us?” I look up sharply, eyes wide with awe, brimming with hopeful curiosity.","\n","^Now he laughs. “Yes” He says. “I was in a hero in a guild once upon a time, but now I’m looking to raise heroes of my own. Would you perhaps be interested in becoming my student?”","\n","^Shock, joy, hope, elation, emotions run through me, but there are too many to name. I want to say yes immediately. But…","\n","^My smile fades and I hang my head again. “I would be honoured, but I don’t think I can. I am too weak to be a hero.” My heart feels like it’s sinking into the pit of my stomach, but it’s true. I have always been weak, even if I want to be a hero, there is nothing I can do. This most recent adventure taught me that at least. Maybe I should go back home.","\n","^“Do you think so little of me?” The elven man sounded annoyed, to the point of anger. “Do you think I offer you something that I can not provide?”","\n","^I blink at him, surprised and he smiles slyly.","\n","^“You have the spirit of a hero but the body of a weakling. But that is something we can fix.”","\n","^He holds out his hand to me, expectant. “Do you want to be a hero Hankel?”","\n","^Arm trembling, I take his hand. So excited, that I don’t even ask how he knows my name.","\n","ev","str","^Next","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"Prelude_later"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Prelude_later":[["^HANKEL AGE 27","\n","^“Ugh, Ogres, why did it have to be ogres?” The voice echoes in my head, like it always does when my weapon talks to me. “I can’t stand ogres. And the smell!”","\n","^“You don’t even have a nose.” I remind the staff. My weapon, the enchanted staff, rolls its eyes inside my head. I don’t know how he does that, but he just can. “I can still smell them.” The staff insists. “I don’t know how it works. It’s magic. Just go shoving me up anybody’s nose this time. I mean I know I’m indestructible, but it sure doesn’t feel nice.”","\n","^The constant prattle of my inanimate companion is familiar and comforting as I crouch behind the bushes at the cliff’s edge, watching the Ogres make camp in the valley below. Night was falling, the ogres’ fire illuminating the forest valley with an eerie orange glow.","\n","^“How many?”","\n","^“hmm.” The weapon hums to itself as it senses the people below. “Three Ogres, Four humans in the cage to the south, two of them children.”","\n","^“Dammit.” I mutter. “Hostages already.”","\n","^“Are we going in head first?” The staff asks excitedly. “Shall I prep a spell for you?”","\n","^“May as well.” I agree, grunting as I stand and stretch out my legs. “But to keep it directional, We’re trying not to injure the victims this time.”","\n","^“That only happened once.” The staff grumbles quietly.","\n","^Despite the situation, I felt myself smile. I really did enjoy my job.","\n","^“Ready Hankel?” My staff asked, clearly sharing my excitement.","\n","^“Lets go.” I say, bending my knees, I jump. I clear the bushes easily, propelling myself over the cliff’s edge. I drop, falling through the air, the wind whistles through my hair as I fall, landing in a crouch by the fireside in the valley floor below. [Don’t forget to describe the scene with senses, and opinions about e.g. morality.] My back to the metal cage containing the human prisoners, I rise from my crouch to face the three ogres, standing dumbfounded before me.","\n","^“Who’re you?” One of them complains loudly. “We don’t want to nothing to do with you! So clear off.”","\n","^“Yeah, clear off before we hurt you.” Says the second.","\n","^“Didn’t he just fall from the sky? How’d he do that? Does he have wings?” Asks the third, sounding genuinely curious.","\n","^I sighed. Ogres. They were always a tad slow.","\n","^“Spell’s ready.” The staff says inside my head.","\n","^“May as well make this quick.” I say. Taking the staff off my back, I raise it above my head, and bring The end down hard on the ground before me, hoping against hope that he remembered to make it directional.","\n","^A wave of fire blossomed out from the base of the stick, scorching the ground, and the ogres feet, in a wave before me. The front two ogres, howled in pain, and fell onto their backs, clutching at their feet and cursing in pain.","\n","^“Bloody wizards!” Shouts one.","\n","^“Bloody heroes!” Shouts the second.","\n","^I smiled. I felt a pleased feeling emanate from the weapon in my hands. “Oh, that one was a good one.” The staff says. “And I didn’t even set fire the forest this time.” “It was rather satisfying.” I agreed.","\n","^“Have you come to help us?” I hear a scared voice, hoarse from crying, ask from the cage behind me. “Please get us out of here!” Screams the frightened wail of a child.","\n","^“Just a moment.” I say, not taking my eyes off the ogres, as the third ogre, out of range of the blast, surges forward, a club the size of a tree raised in one hand above his head.","\n","^I raise my staff in defence above my head to block the incoming blow, and I hear ogre laugh.","\n","^“You think that puny stick can stop me? I’ll snap it like a twig!” The ogre raws, and brings down the massive club hard on the staff.","\n","^“I don’t think so.” I brace my elbows and knees as the blow hits, and grunting I hold the staff in place. It doesn’t break, it doesn’t even bend. The oversized club cracks then shatters in that one almighty blow. Wooden splinters rain down from above and the ogre drops his damaged weapon in surprise.","\n","^I step forward. “Don’t underestimate my mighty weapon.” The ogres, all three of whom are now back on their feet, step backward, fear visible in their eyes.","\n","^“I-I know who you are.” One of them stutters, eyes wide, voice trembling.","\n","^I can’t help but let a grin stretch across my face. “And who am I?”","\n","^“You’re Hankel, the mighty hero. From that guild!”","\n","^“What guild?” Demands the second ogre, who’s face is simply coloured with anger.","\n","^“The guild of mighty heroes and their mighty weapons. I hear they’re invincible.”","\n","^“Him? You’re him?” the ogre stutters. Then after a moments pause, the three ogres glance at each other, and make a run for it. Fleeing back down the valley away the hero and his stick.","\n","^“Well that was easy.” The staff said. I can hear him grinning in my mind.","\n","^“Well done partner.”","\n","^“Are you sure you should just let them go like that?” Asks the young man in the cage. “Why are you letting him get away?”","\n","^“Shh!” Says his wife, elbowing him in the ribs, their two children clutching at her skirt. “Thank you, thank you!” She says, lowering her head to me. Tears filling up her eyes. Though I’m not sure if they’re tears of gratitude, relief or fear.","\n","^“It’s alright. And besides,” I say, letting myself smile once more. “They won’t get far.”","\n","^Several minutes later, a man walks up to the camp, dragging three large bodies behind him. Three ogres trussed up with ropes tied around their ankles. They were unconscious.","\n","^“I see you got my gift, [name].” I said, sitting by the fire. The man [description] smiles, pausing at the fireside. “They ran away from you didn’t they?” He asks. “Hankel, you show off.”","\n","^I laugh, offering him a flask. He takes it and drinks deeply. “Another job done. I should get back to the guild, see the others. You coming?”","\n","^“In a bit.”","\n","^We stay there in silence for a moment, staring up at the distant twinkling stars. “Did you ever think you could be a hero?” [name] asks. His voice distant, full of wonder.","\n","^“I hoped” I admit. “But I never it would really happen, not until I met him. I knew I was too weak to be a hero.”","\n","^“You weak?” he laughs.","\n","^“Yes believe it or not. I was such a frail child, arms like twigs.”","\n","^“And you still took on a troll?” he said shaking his head. They’d all heard the story. It was one of my mentor’s favourites.","\n","^[name] says goodbye, and sets off back to the city with his quarry. I content to linger fall into a comfortable silence, staring at the stars.","\n","^“Have we done it Hankel?” The quiet voice of my staff echoes in my mind again, hopeful, awed. “Have we made it at last?”","\n","^I look up at the stars, smiling. Thinking of the years spent to get to this point, the journeys and trials, adventures and hardships and a bright future. “I think we have, my friend.

I see flashes of the city between the faces of the crowd. [Brief description of destruction]. The people stare at me with their dark eyes, angry and bereaved, many of them still in shock, the attack had been sudden and brutal, destroying much of this quarter of the city. A stone, thrown from the crowd strikes me in the forehead, and I reach up to touch the place where it had hit. Shock. Yes it has only been a few days since my world fell apart. I remember their faces, the faces of the now dead. The children, the young faces in the guild, they used to greet me with wide smiles whenever I returned. Yosdil, and Evern, older members of the guild, from the first generation. Master too, even Master, my precious mentor, with his pointed ears, greyish skin and long fingered hands, burned and scared, his voice low and gruff, not at all like an elf’s should be. The man who helped me to be all I could be. Gone. All of them gone.","\n","^“This is your fault!” Screams a voice from the crowd. “Your fault! Give back my son, hero!” The last word, is uttered so violently that it sounds like a curse. A truly vile insult.","\n","^Shock. I still couldn’t feel anything yet. I had cried and wailed, but all in shock, and with the shadow of feelings. Everything was ruined. The guild hall brunt to cinders, everything ash and melted metal. Then the rest of the city, houses, people, roads, shops, children, all burnt. They had come for the guild apparently, whoever they had been. In payment for some perceived wrong done by us many years ago. And in a rage they had destroyed everything. They had been long gone by the time I arrived back in the city. Everything gone.","\n","^I am guided, held tightly by the arms, up the steps to the city hall, or what remained of city hall, this building too had suffered damage, the once pristine building was scorched and blackened, and a large section of one wall had melted away. As I stand on the steps, I can look over the crowd and in the distance I see a painfully familiar sight, men piling corpses. They have no time to consider me, busy with their work.","\n","^I am lead inside. The door closes behind me with a heavy thud.","\n","^They lead me inside the main chamber, and I stare blankly up at the city elders, who loom down on me from above, the same dark faces as the crowd outside. Anger, grief, shock and pain. The trolls jerk my arm, pushing me to stand on the raised platform in the centre of the room, opposite the high table where sit my accusers.","\n","^I glance around me, and note other faces I recognise sitting or standing in the audience seats around the room. Near me, stands [name], his face a picture of anger and grief. At least a familiar face.","\n","^The severe faced woman looms down on from her position at the high table as the room fills. I watch as she stands and begins to speak.","\n","^“We have witnessed a calamity in our city. An attack from a foreign group of sorcerers, laid waste to our city, our lives and our guilds. For years we have stood behind our champions of justice, the heroes, that have protected us for so long. But now that time has passed. Where were the heroes of our city when they came and slaughtered hundreds? Where were the mighty guilds that have pledged to protect us. These guilds, these so called heroes have done nothing to prevent the damage and destruction we have seen in our city. In fact it was an act of one of these so called hero guilds that caused this tragic event in the first place.” The vulture faced woman says to the crowd. Pointing a long bony finger at me.","\n","^“The guild of mighty heroes and their mighty weapons, you have all heard off I’m sure. Many years they served us, and aided our city. However tales of their recklessness and violence you have heard also. Many people in distant lands fear and dread the very name of this guild, as the destruction they bring upon others in name of justice. It was this guild, these very men before you today which brought the destruction down upon us all. As the attack to the city was in direct retribution for the attack upon members of their sect by this guild.”","\n","^I lowered my head, as the mutterings around the room grew louder.","\n","^“Not only was this guild responsible for the attack, but they failed to prevent it! The attackers, to our knowledge challenged this man” she says, shaking her finger in my direction to emphasise her words. “to a duel in order to spare the damage to the city, but he did not. He could not, for he was not here to answer the challenge. How can we live in safety in our homes when men like this cause recklessly bring retribution upon us, but fail to protect us from harm? Our heroes have been allowed to roam unchecked for too long! And this man! This man and his guild are too blame for the suffering of many.” I raise my head and see her looking at me, pain in her eyes. “I lost my family today because of your guilds’ reckless actions, and your failure as a hero. If you had been here I have little doubt that this destruction could have been spared. But you were not. You have failed to uphold the oath you took to this city as a hero of its people. And you have cost many lives.”","\n","^A room full of eyes turned to stare at me. I could see anger in the eyes of some. Hatred, rage. Pain and sorrow in others, guilt, longing. And in the eyes of others, nothing at all.","\n","^“Do you accept the responsibility for these lives you failed to save?” The woman asks me, her voice trembling as she speaks. “As the current leader of the guild of mighty heroes and their mighty weapons, as our greatest hero, for your last duty to our city, do you accept the responsibility for what has happened here? To your own guild mates, your friends and students, even your precious master, do you accept that you are to blame for the loss of these lives?”","\n","^I stare at them, as they wait for my response.","\n","^A trickle of emotion bleeds through the haze of grief and fog that surround my mind.

The heat here at the southern part of the city was unbearable, the dust from the dry ground clung to the skin of workmen as they sweated, hauling chunks of stone and hoisting them to the top of the newly built wall. Not to mention the smell, the odour of unwashed bodies was not the worst of it. I sniffed the air, and regretted it almost immediately.","\n","^“Why are we working here Hankel?” The staff whines. “Surely there are better places for you to be working than this, hot, dry stinking place.

The dwarf, still giving me unpleasant looks, falls down into the shade of the wall beside me.","\n","^He says nothing more to me, just scowls at the ground, as we wait for our brief break to be over.","\n","^I wouldn’t be surprised if he recognises me.

Not that it would be worth it.","\n","^“They’ve short changed you again!” The staff complains, getting angry once more. “Your bowl isn’t even half full!” I sigh, I appreciate that my friend gets angry on my behalf, but I really wish he would just drop it sometimes.

The world is different. I’m different. There’s no place for heroes any more. Even if I wanted to I… I can’t.” My voice falters and I hang my head. We fall into silence as we cross the darkened park.

Do people always live like this?” Somehow, grumbling makes me feel better. The shock of last nights events has mostly warn off by now. And my friend seems to be in a cheerful enough mood. But I’m still concerned. Whatever is wrong with the enchantment, doesn’t seem to be happening quickly, but still. Nobody I had spoken too could make heads or tails of the enchantment. Nobody except master but he… well. It had been one of the things that had made the guild famous. The mighty enchanted weapons that no one had ever been able to replicate. I didn’t know much about masters work. He had been kicked out of the magic community for his unorthodox practices, which he used to use on himself, before we came along. Then after our guild grew in fame, the magical community had scrambled to learn his secrets. But to my knowledge, he hadn’t told a soul. This enchanter was apparently the best in the city. I felt a slight pang as I wondered if sharing my mentor’s secrets was an insult to him somehow. But, well. I had to.","\n","^“At least now you’re finally acting your age.” the staff mumbles.

Then again, maybe that was why.","\n","^I could hear hurried footsteps inside, muffled bangs of closing doors, and then quiet. After what seemed like several long minutes, the door opened about an inch and a sliver of a face peered out, frowning.","\n","^“What?” the face asks as the door opens several inches more. The man, a half-elf, has slightly pointed ears, and slightly grey toned skin, from his elven heritage, and sports a pair of thick rimmed, glasses, perched on the end of his nose, as well as a long thin, wispy beard, brown with streaks of grey, though by all reports the man was in his 80’s.","\n","^The sleek greying eyebrows narrowed at me suspiciously, and I wonder if the man was too much of a hermit to recognise me.","\n","^“Are you here with the muffins?” He asks, his single raised eyebrow seeming to doubt this.","\n","^“I doubt it.” I managed not to smile as I responded, though I could hear the staff giggle in my mind.","\n","^“Then you must be a customer.” The enchanter says, his tone suggesting that this would be the height of rudeness.","\n","^“Well, excuse me!” the enchanter recoils at the staffs words, apparently he had been included in the conversation. “But this is the right place isn’t it? You are the enchanter aren’t you? Or are we just wasting our time.”","\n","^“I am the enchanter. The only enchanter worth knowing at any rate.” [name] the enchanter sniffs with hurt pride and disapproval. Probably to hide his confusion. He swings the door open wide and steps back to consider me fully. Then after a moment, his eyes seem to shine behind his glasses, and  a smile creeps across his face. It is not a pleasant smile.","\n","^“Well, well, well. What brings Hankel the hero to my door? Never expected to see you here of all people.”","\n","^“You know me then.” I don’t bother making it a question.","\n","^“Doesn’t everybody?” He says, smirking, then gestures for us to come inside, looking around with furtive glances, before shutting the door quickly. Odd. I gaze around the room. The building, which looks normal from the outside, doesn’t share this same flaw on the inside. There are [description] and the whole place is just brimming with magic.

I couldn’t tell if it active or not. “Curious.” I felt the staff murmur in my head.","\n","^“But yes,” He continues, like nothing happened. “I recognise you from [mentor’s] letters of course.” then noting my look of confusion, “I was an old friend of his, we swapped notes occasionally. But I don’t suppose he ever mentioned me.” He adds with a sad sort of smirk. Clearing his throat he continued, moving around the room to stand behind a large wooden desk covered with delicate golden contraptions and papers covered with barely legible magic scrawl, the mark of a true wizard of course being illegibility.","\n","^“Regardless of introductions, I can guess you’re here.” He says, nodding to the staff.","\n","^The man talks fast and moves fast.

The druid was asking about his work, and wanted help with something, I don’t know what, but father refused. Then, the man must have said something, because father got very angry, and threw the man out. But later, he came back. And he kept coming back. Father was getting annoyed, and worried, the man wanted him to do something, but wouldn’t explain why. So he looked into his research. And I don’t know what he found, but he didn’t like it. He said it was dangerous, and he wouldn’t get involved. But the druid wouldn’t leave him alone. Then, eventually he stopped coming, father said they’d came to an agreement.

To improve nature, to improve life itself!”","\n","^“By making sure that nobody ever dies?” I ask, keeping my voice bland. “I doubt you’re going to improve any one’s life if what your research produces are those poor creatures outside. I think I’d rather die right now, if you’re going planning on ‘upgrading’ me like that. No thanks.”","\n","^I could practically hear the young man grinding his teeth together. “Those are merely an early experiment. My foray into necromancy, however diverting, sadly did not produce the correct results.” his pale lips split into an eery smile. “They did however provide me with a lead. Do you know what the secret to immortality is my dear hero?”","\n","^“Practise?”","\n","^The man tutted at me. Actually wagging his finger. “I’m sure you think you’re very clever Mr Hankel, trying to taunt me into loosing my patience, but no good it going to come of it you know. I know you’re frightened.”","\n","^“Oh that’s not it.” I say smiling. “You’re just not very good at this. Though I’m sure you’re world class magician, you’re not so good at monologuing.”","\n","^He looked at me, holding my eyes for a moment, then scoffing, turns and walks to the back of the room.","\n","^In truth I was frightened. But not of this man. Perhaps I should be. I reasoned. I was powerless right now after all. I had no strength, no weapon, few allies, and a splitting headache that felt like my eyes would start to bleed out of my skull from the very pressure. I had been in these situations before, many, many times. But not for a long time had I felt so helpless. And I didn’t like feeling helpless.","\n","^The druid walks back across the room, holding my staff in his hands, outstretched, like it was some kind of ancient relic. Suddenly I grow very, very cold.","\n","^“The answer to immortality,” the druid says, laying the stick on a table before me. “lies within the soul itself.

He tried it on himself first, apparently the process was quite painful. I’m sure he was thrilled when you came along, begging to made stronger. You were the best experiment he ever produced you know. A magical first.”","\n","^The druid pauses as if waiting for my response to his taunt. I grit my teeth. Trying to force down my anger, and ignore his words. I manage to hold my tongue.","\n","^The druid lets out a theatrical sigh. “If only I knew how he did it. I lamented his death for months, he didn’t tell anyone how he did it you see. I was utterly depressed. But I knew that it was possible.” He steps closer. His breath, like leaf rot and decomposing plant matter sticks to my face. “But I am delighted, that I get the chance to find out.” He says.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Druid.0.48.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","str","^I say nothing","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":22},{"s":["^\"...\" ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Druid.0.49.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":18},{"s":["^“Who were you?” ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Druid.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.48.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"^ ",{"->":"reunion_one"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"Druid.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.49.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],{"->":"Druid_question"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Druid_question":[["^“What?” the question seems to put the young man off guard.","\n","^I nod, gesturing to the room at large. “How did you get here?

His face however is twisted in a look of revulsion. “You know, I always thought your mentor’s greatest work had something of a flaw.” His hands grip the wood so tight I can hear it begin to creak. “This toy of yours is nothing more than a mistake in his work you know. A side effect, if you will.”","\n","^I grit my teeth, and flex my wrists as he speaks, trying to pull myself free.

He waves his hands around the room in complex gestures, and I feel the vines around me loosen and fall away.","\n","^“There.” Says the older wizard, slightly out of breath. “Nothing will be getting in here for a little while at least.” He says before turning to me and scowling.","\n","^“What the damnation are you doing here?” He says, as I pull myself free of the vines. Across the room, Gabor bursts out of his, tearing through them with his thick stony arms. “Father!” The gollem shouts, lumbering over to where the enchanter stands. “What are you doing here?” The enchanter asks, crossly. “I warned you to stay away if anything like this should happen, and you even got caught!

He wanted to use the technique your master discovered, to power a magically enchanted immortal body. Not that dissimilar to your own enchantment in fact.”","\n","^I frown. So at least that part was true. “My mentor’s work. It has something to do with soul manipulation didn’t it?” The enchanter’s brows furrow but he doesn’t deny it. He nods. “I don’t know what got him interested in it originally. That kind of research has always been banned by the members of the circle. But the theory has been around for a very long time.”","\n","^A morbid curiosity burned at me, while at the same time filling me with dread. Did I really want to know? “Explain it to me.”","\n","^The old man seemed to be getting annoyed, his brow lines became deeper but he continued. “It has long been theorised that the source of our magic comes from our souls. Not the souls themselves, but the immortal realms that our souls come from. Our souls act as gateways to those realms, allowing us access to magic. Some gates open wider than others, and some don’t seem to open at all, depending on the person. Or at least that is the idea. For a long time, it has been a theory held by certain members of the circle that if one could manipulate the soul somehow, and keep the gate open forever, then that person could access immense, possible endless magical power. You can perhaps see why this research was banned within the circle. But your mentor had a workable theory. He had an idea how to manipulate the soul in such a way as to keep the gate open permanently. He proposed his idea to the circle and was kicked out by his peers for suggesting it. So he tried it on himself.”","\n","^“And it worked.” I prompt, listening with wrapped attention. I look back at the man within my memories with a sense of awe. Well, he always had said that he was a genius.","\n","^The old enchanter gives a shaky smile. “When he first shared his theory with me I’m ashamed to say I didn’t think it would work. But yes. It did.”","\n","^“That was what the druid wanted you to do for him.” I guessed.","\n","^The enchanter’s smile fades into an expression tinted with sadness. “Something like that.” he admits. “Your mentor had worked out that the gateway was open widest when the soul was in the process of separating from the body, or dying, for lack of a better word. And if the soul could be suspended in that state then the person would be granted unending magical power. However, rather than doing that, he tricked his own soul, by separating a portion of it from himself. Via that small portion of his soul that was separate from his body, sealed away in an object, he managed to prop the gate open permanently. Through the object, that contained the sealed portion of his soul, he could access an endless stream of magic. It was the same basic theory that he used to create your mighty weapons I believe.”","\n","^I glance down the staff in my hand, frowning. It remains silent. “He separated a portion of my soul?”","\n","^The enchanter gave me a curious look. “I believe so. Though he likely improved the process since he first tested it on himself. Does that upset you?”","\n","^I shrug the issue away. “It just seems odd.”","\n","^“It make sense however. Didn’t you ever wonder why your enchantment has lasted so long? An enchantment such as yours would require an immense amount of magical energy on a near constant basis.”","\n","^I hadn’t really thought about it before. “Well, it seems like his theory still has some flaws.” I say, the corner of my mouth twitching. The staff in my hand, feeling like little more than ordinary wood. “I fear the enchantment will not last much longer.”","\n","^“That is troubling.” The greying half-elf sounds genuinely concerned. But his look isn’t aimed at me, but at Gabor, who is lingering in the darkened corner of the lab, transfixed by something.","\n","^“Did you find anything useful?” I call out to him, following his gaze. I freeze.","\n","^“Not exactly.” I hear him say, his voice is thin and strained.","\n","^[Descriptions: There is a man, clearly once a human, strapped to a table. In the middle of the very disturbing process of being turned into a plant-zombie. It is still alive, though only groaning and not coherent.]","\n","^This isn’t right. No man should do this. Anger. I look upon the figure of what used to be a person and anger fills me.","\n","^“This?” Gabor’s voice is cold and hard, seething with restrained fury. It sends shivers down my spine. “This is what that druid was doing? This was how he professed to improve life?” His stone fists creak and groan as they clench.","\n","^The enchanter looks away.","\n","^“This is truly an evil work.” I say as pity and sadness flow in as well. “And any ‘improvements’ made due to work such as this, are evil as well. I bad tree cannot bear good fruit.” I mutter through clenched teeth. “This entire place needs to be burnt to the ground.” I turn away from the man strapped to the table, or whatever was left of him. The others walk on, leaving the horrid sight behind. But I pause. I wonder who he was, or if there are any people missing him, and wondering where he is. Does he have children perhaps, who are eagerly looking forward to their father coming home. A moment that will never come again. The man gasps again, and moving his lips as he moans another feeble word. But I can hear it this time.","\n","^“Please.”","\n","^I grit my teeth. Glancing at the tools on the table beside him. I pick up one of the knives used to carve symbols into flesh, it feels filthy in my hands, just to touch it. This perhaps is the only thing I can do for him.","\n","^The enchanter looks grim, and pale faced when I catch up the others. Gabor is still wearing an angry scowl and there is unpleasant tension in the air. I keep my distance, lurking on the edge of hearing.","\n","^“Is that the kind of work that you were helping him with?” Gabor’s voice is sad, but tinted with cold anger. “How could help a man like that? I looked up to you! Why did you do it? Why?!” Gabor’s cold voice continues to rise, rising into a bitter shout.","\n","^“Because he knew about you.” The enchanter shouts back. “He threatened to tell the council about you, about my work. They would have taken you away.”","\n","^“But why? I’m just a gollem. Something you created form stone and magic. You could easily create another.”","\n","^“No. I could never replace you.” The enchanter casts his face down, holding his head in his hands, like he is ashamed to look up into Gabor’s brilliant green eyes.","\n","^“What is so special about me? That you need to hide all the time? Why? I am just a gollem!”","\n","^The old man doesn’t raise his head, not even at the bitterness in Gabor’s voice.","\n","^“Except you’re not just a gollem are you?” Gabor turns to me as I speak. But the enchanter just sinks further to the ground. Head in his hands. So I go on. “The more I thought about it the less sense it made. Gollems can’t speak. They can’t feel emotions either. They have no magic of their own. And they can’t function without their master’s commands. You’re not a gollem.” I say, turning to the enchanter I ask, “What did you do?”","\n","^[The enchanter breaks down and admits that Gabor was once a real person. His own son. He was working on his own theory for suspending a soul in the process of dying in magic stone. When his son Gabor got very sick and was about to die.]","\n","^“The theory was ready.” The enchanter seemed so small as he spoke, just a broken old man. “I knew it would work, but I hadn’t tried it before.”","\n","^“So you tried it on your own son.” I prompt. Gabor remains silent.","\n","^“I was desperate. And it worked! I created a gollem’s body for you. Your memories before the event, I hid them from you, in order to protect you. It would be easier for you if you thought you were a gollem.”","\n","^[Gabor gets angry that he didn’t tell him.] “Why didn’t you tell me? Did you think I’d be mad? Or disappointed? Did you think I wouldn’t love you anymore if you told me? Why didn’t you tell me? “I was frightened, I thought that you might hate me for what I’d done to you.”","\n","^Gabor’s face, somehow seemed to express all the pain in his words. The pain only a child could feel. “I’m just sorry that you didn’t trust me enough to tell me the truth.”","\n","^Gabor turns from the old man, his father, who remain still, kneeling on the floor.","\n","^“When he found out, he threatened to use Gabor’s magical heart, where I sealed the soul away, in his experiments. So instead of my son, I offered to make him another.” The man finally raises his head. Though I can see no tears, there are telltale marks on his face. “Do you think badly of me for what I have done?”","\n","^I turn to look after Gabor. “It’s my opinion you have to worry about is it?” In truth I did not. Not really. I wouldn’t feel right judging the man, not after everything I have done. He clearly felt some regret. But, to protect his son? That I could understand.","\n","^I turn to leave the room, suddenly feeling very tired. My feeling of unease returns as my all my pains seem to overload my mind.","\n","^A sudden stab of pain shoots through my chest and I fall my knees, crying out. In my mind, I can hear the voice of the staff, screaming.","\n","^I hear heavy stone footsteps as Gabor hurries over to my side. “The enchantment, it’s wearing off. Something is wrong.”","\n","^“Damn.” The enchanter curses. Following after as Gabor lifts me, and places me on a nearby workbench, staff clutched to my chest. I feel pain, searing every inch of my body, as if I’m bathed in fire. Through pain hazed eyes I see the enchanter leaning over me, speaking words I can barely understand. “Your soul separation is failing, I’m going to try and reinforce it, keep still!”","\n","^I fade in and out of consciousness as the enchanter pokes and prods at me, muttering strange words.","\n","^I realise I can feel another presence, a second consciousness, linked to mine, tethered, like by a rope. The portion of my soul, I realise. My staff. But the rope is fraying, unravelling and it is drifting further and further away. I reach out, calling to it, telling it not to go. But no good comes of it. It is held there only by a single fraying strand.

But your bond with your separated soul has weakened.” His uncertain pause makes my blood run cold. “Perhaps if we get back to workshop, given enough time, I could I try to repair the bond, I fear unless something is done quickly, the separated portion of your soul, your staff, will drift away. It will likely be… painful. In more ways than one.”","\n","^“Bond?” I ask. “What exactly is the problem.”","\n","^“The fact of the matter is, I do not know. Originally your mentor created his own split soul by tearing off a portion and sealing it in an object. But with yours he did something slightly different that I still don’t fully understand. With you, and your fellow guild mates, he sought to share your souls, rather than tear them, though the result was similar, it was a longer, gentler process. He created bonds between yourselves and an object that you were close to. Through that bond you were able to transfer a portion of your soul to the object, unconsciously over time. As I understand, it, the fact that this process gave them personalities, was actually an accident.” He smiled.","\n","^“I remember that” I smile. “Though the memory is vague. The first thing I did for him was mopping his floor. For about 6 months I did nothing but mop. He got me to speak to it as I did so. Speak to it about myself. Pour out your soul, he said. I thought he was being stupid. For years, nobody knew that the mighty weapon I wielded, was actually just an old mop handle.”","\n","^“It’s a difficult conclusion to come to when the only time people ever see it is when it’s breaking their kneecaps or shooting fire from its end.” The enchanter said with amusement. “But yes. That sounds about right. Without knowing exactly what caused the bond between you and your object to fray I cannot fix it. The link to your separated soul is fading. It is drifting from you. The gateway that for so long has been propped open, is being forced shut. Perhaps if the damage had been seen earlier, then the bond could have been repaired.
