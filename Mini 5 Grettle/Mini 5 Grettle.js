Fearful for her life, the wife decided to sacrifice their children so the two of them could live.","\n","^\"Take the children far into the woods\" she told her husband, \"and leave them there so that they die in the woods, then we shall have enough to eat.\" The woodcutter did not want to for he cared much for their children, but eventually, he gave in to his wife's demand.","\n","^Overhearing this, the children snuck out of their room the night before they were to go into the woods, and collected a pile of white pebbles.","\n","^When the woodcutter took them out into the woods the next day, they left a trail of the white pebbles as they went so that they would not get lost. And so when they were left in the woods, the children waited until night fell, and the moon shone on the white pebbles, making the path home clear.","\n","^When they returned home the wife was surprised and not very happy.","\n","^\"Take them deeper into the woods next time, to make sure they can't find their way back!\" The wife told her husband.","\n","^Again, the children overheard this, and so tried to sneak out once more to collect more white pebbles, but the door was locked!","\n","^So when morning came the children quickly tried to find something else to use to guide their way home. The children grabbed some bread, and left a trail of breadcrumbs into the forest.","\n","^But when they were alone, they couldn't find their way back, as the breadcrumbs had been eaten by birds!  They were lost in the woods.","\n","^Lost in the woods, the children see a beautiful white bird an they follow it until they see a cottage made of cake, and gingerbread and candy. Tired and hungry they take some of the little house and begin to eat it.","\n","^Then the door opens and out comes an old woman, who invites them inside.","\n","^They follow the woman into the house, but then she traps them, and they realise that she is a witch!","\n","^One of the children she locks up, and feed him well, meaning to fatten him up and eat him. His sister the witch keeps as a slave, and feeds her very little.","\n","^Everyday the witch would check his finger, seeing how fat the boy had got, to see if he was ready to eat. But the boy, seeing that her eyesight was bad, each time put out a bone from the cage and not his own finger, so the witch thought that he wasn't getting bigger and was still too lean to eat.","\n","^But one day, she decided that enough was enough, and she was going to eat him fat or not.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"0.36.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":18},{"s":["^Grettle ",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":"0.36.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"Grettle"},{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"Grettle":[["^It had been weeks and weeks since they had been captured by the witch.
